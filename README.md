# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
This app was intended to be an inventory management app. It was required to have a login screen and a database to store information. Additionally, an optional SMS notification feature was implemented.

# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
I kept the UI minimalist, only adding elements if they were required. While I believe the overall layout of the app turned out fine, the app is still clearly a prototype. That being said, the use of few activities and simple UI makes using the app intuitive.

# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
Research. There's rarely a point to reinventing the wheel. If a solution already exists, then its better to learn from it than start from scratch. I also coded the app and designed the simultaneously, switching back and forth as the needs of one affected the other. I tend to be more successful on projects when I take this approach.

# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I performed dynamic testing to ensure the app worked as intended. This included manually testing every feature as well is feeding in bad inputs to see how the code would handle them. I also tested with multiple virtual machines in different resolutions and orientations to test the app's consistency across devices.

# Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
There were some things that I wasn't able to implement in the way I initially desired due to some quirks that I was unaware of. I ended up refactoring these areas into code that worked, despite being different from my original design.

# In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
The app's database relates closest to my OOP experience and is easily the part I am most satisfied with.
